   		   1. Concept Name - Official name of the concept<br /><br>
		   2. Concept Type - the database or source of the concept<br /><br>
		   3. # Genes - the number of input genes that belong to the concept<br /><br>
		   4. Coeff - the estimated beta coefficient from the logistic regression model (a significant value &gt; 0 implies enrichment or 'up' 
		   regulation, a significant value &lt; 0 implies depletion or 'down' regulation)<br /><br>
		   5. OddsRatio - the odds ratio for enrichment (a significant value &gt; 1 implies enrichment or 'up' regulation, a significant value 
		   &lt; 1 implies depletion or 'down' regulation) (The p-values used to calculate the odds ratio can be adjusted in the Advanced Options section.)<br /><br>
		   6. P-value - the p-value for enrichment/depletion<br /><br>
		   7. FDR - the False Discovery Rate, estimated using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (When results are sorted by p-value, a FDR &lt; 0.05 
		   is interpreted to mean that approximately 5% of the concepts with lesser or equal p-value are false positives.)<br /><br>
		   8. Direction - If a directional test was chosen, 'up' or 'down' is provided. If a non-directional test was chosen, 'Enriched' or 'Depleted' is provided.<br /><br>
		   9. SigGenes - comma delimited list of all the Entrez Gene IDs that had p-value &lt; 0.05 in the concept. The p-value cutoff value used can 
		   be adjusted in the Advanced Options section.<br><br>
