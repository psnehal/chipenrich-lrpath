Description: This package contains functions to perform functional enrichment testing using logistic regression. The method models the significance levels (x-axis) against gene set membership (y-axis). Several types of biological gene sets may be tested against in addition to GO and KEGG, and one may test enrichment for all differential expression, or use a directional test for up- versus down-regulated genes.
